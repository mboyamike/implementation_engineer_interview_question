# Section A.

## 1. Give examples of different integration protocols you have come across and give example scripts in python 3 on how to achieve each one.

## 2. Give a walkthrough of how you will manage a data streaming application sending one million notifications every hour while giving examples of technologies and configurations you will use to manage load and asynchronous services.

## 3. Give examples of different encryption/hashing methods you have come across and give example scripts in python 3 on how to achieve each one.
### Encryption
### Hashing
Hashing involves passing some data through a one way function. The function transforms the data to a fixed length result. It is very difficult to convert it back to the original data. This is useful, for example, in storing passwords as even if a malicious user is able to gain access to where the passwords are stored, he/she will be unable to get the actual password. Only viewing the hash is of less value than if the password was stored as plain text. There are several hashing algorithms such as MD5, SHA256 and SHA512 

# Section B.

## 1. Create a login and a success page in Django. A mockup of the created pages should also be submitted. The mockups should have been created by using advanced design/wireframe tools thus showcasing prowess in usage of the tools and use of production server deployments on uwsgi/nginx. Ensure that the sessions are well and securely managed.
